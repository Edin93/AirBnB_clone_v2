# HBNB 2.0

This is the console /command interpreter for the Holberton Airbnb clone project. The console can be used to store objects in and retrieve objects from a JSON.

### Supported classes:
* BaseModel
* User
* State
* City
* Amenity
* Place
* Review

### Commands:
* create - create an object
* show - show an object (based on id)
* destroy - destroy an object
* all - show all objects, of one type or all types
* quit/EOF - quit the console
* help - see descriptions of commands

To start, navigate to the project folder and enter `./console.py` in the shell.
